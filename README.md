# ElectricGuitarHomepage
#### Description: Homepage dedicated to the electric guitar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project is a homepage dedictated to the electric guitar. I have played guitar on and off for 18 years and it is one of my favorite hobbies. The homepage was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes a navigation bar as well as page selectors near the bottom of each page that change color when they are hovered over. This was a fun project to work on, especially since it is on a subject that I am interested in.
